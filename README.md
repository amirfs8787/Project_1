# Project_1
My first project in my Full Stack Web Developers Course at John Bryce College.

This is the first project I had to do, when I was in the beginning stages of the course.  It involves HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

The project is a task board, where a user can enter (as well as delete) tasks, and the date of completion, and then see the task on the screen.
